## Personal Notes

1. My preparation for AWS Solutions Architect Associate primarily relied on **Maarek's** course **Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate 202X** at Udemy. The course itself includes one set of practice questions (65 questions).
1. In addition to the course, I also got **Practice Exams | AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate** from **Maarek** and **Singh** (Udemy again). This contains 6 sets of practice questions (65 questions each set).
1. I did each set of the practice questions from **Maarek** and **Singh** at least 4-5 times. The nice part of the practice questions from **Maarek** and **Singh** is that it offers explanations and mostly well sourced/documented. That helps for better impressions about AWS services and implementations per the given requirements.
1. Note for the purcahse of Udemy courses- do NOT purchase a course at its full price. **Wait for Udemy promotions for a much lower price.** Udemy offers discounts from time to time, at least 2-3 times a month. And the offered discounts vary at different times. If one is not in a hurry, one can visit Udemy often, observe, then act.
1. Dump Collections is a site that offers practice questions for various certificate exams. My observation for the practice questions **for AWS SAA C03** from Dumps Collection includes:
   - Pros: (1) the number of praction questions is good (800+). (2) One can get updates for free within 90 days of the purchase (though I didn't use the update feature).
   - Cons: (1) The answer to a question _may not_ be correct (at least for AWS SAA C03). There exist several questions that the answers don't fit the explanations. In those cases, the explanations look right so the answer is likely wrong. In few cases, the answer to a question does not look right and no explanation is available. So one needs to use it with caution. The positive from this is to force one to verify the answers to the questions. The negative is it takes longer to do the questions. (2) The price for the practice questions from Dumps Collection is higher than others.
