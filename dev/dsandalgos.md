## Data Structures <a name="ds"></a>

A **data structure** is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge about data structures.

**<u>Common data structures</u>**

- **[Arrays](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-arrays-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/)**: ordered collection of elements
- **[Linked Lists](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-data-structure/)**: collections where each element points to the next.
- **[Set](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-set-data-structure/)**: collections of distinct elements
- **[Queue](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-data-structure/)**: a linear data structure that follows FIFO (First In First Out) Principle
- **[Stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/)**: Stack is a linear data structure that follows LIFO (Last In First Out) Principle
- **[Map](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-map-data-structure/)**: also known as dictionaries or associative arrays, are fundamental data structures that allow you to efficiently store and retrieve data based on unique keys.
- **[Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-tree-data-structure/)**: a hierarchical structure that is used to represent and organize data in the form of parent child relationship.
- **[Graph](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-graphs-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/)**: a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes/vertices and edges. It is useful in fields such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and computer networks.

Arrays vs. Linked List

|                    | Linked List                                           | Array                                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Data Structure     | Non-contiguous                                        | Contiguous                             |
| Memory Allocation  | Typically allocated one by one to individual elements | Typically allocated to the whole array |
| Insertion/Deletion | Efficient                                             | Inefficient                            |
| Access             | Sequential                                            | Random                                 |

## Algorithms <a name="algos"></a>

An **algorithm** is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions that can be used to solve a computational problem. It provides a step-by-step procedure that convert an input into a desired output.

Algorithms typically follow a logical structure:

- Input: The algorithm receives input data.
- Processing: The algorithm performs a series of operations on the input data.
- Output: The algorithm produces the desired output.

Algorithms are essential for solving complex computational problems efficiently and effectively. They provide a systematic approach to:

- Solving problems: Algorithms break down problems into smaller, manageable steps.
- Optimizing solutions: Algorithms find the best or near-optimal solutions to problems.
- Automating tasks: Algorithms can automate repetitive or complex tasks, saving time and effort.

**<u>Common algorithm categories</u>**

- **[Sorting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/)**: arranging data in a specific order
- **[Searching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/searching-algorithms/)**: finding specific elements within a data structure
- **[Graph traversal](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-data-structure-and-algorithms/)**: visiting each node in a graph
- **[Recursion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursion-algorithms/)**: a technique where a function calls itself

## Code Challenges <a name="code_challenges"></a>

Below is some web sites that offer code challenges practice. Personally, I prefer **NeedCode** though **LeetCode** may be mentioned more often.

- [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
- [Codility](https://app.codility.com/programmers/)
