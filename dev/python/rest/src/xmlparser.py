"""
Section: 2.1.1.3

Estimated time: 15-25 minutes

Level of difficulty: Easy

Objectives
Learn how to:

    read and parse simple XML files using the xml.etree.ElementTree module;
    deal with XML nodes and properties.

Scenario
Download and open the following XML file in your favorite text editor:

nyse.xml

It's a small excerpt of the New York Stock Exchange quotes list. Take a look at it and analyze its structure. You need to do this as your task is to write a code which reads the data and presents it in a form similar to this one:

Command prompt -- Stock Exchange

Hints:

    don't forget to handle at least two possible exceptions: FileNotFoundError and xml.etree.ElementTree.ParseError;
    feel free to improve and beautify the output â€” we know perfectly well that ours is not very sophisticated and rather ugly.
