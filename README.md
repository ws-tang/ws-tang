## About
Hello, thank you for your visit.

I am a full stack software engineer with extensive experience in software development in Java, JakartaEE/J2EE, and other things.

As technologies envolve in the software development world, keeping up to date becomes critical. I use GitHub as my playground to try new things for me.

My current (private) project is on the JavaScript stack with REACT and Node.js.
